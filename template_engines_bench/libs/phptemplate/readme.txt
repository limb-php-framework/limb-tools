Drupal: 4.5.0 , and CVS

********************************************************************
DESCRIPTION:

This is a theme engine for Drupal 4.5.0, which allows the use
of templates written in pure PHP. This engine is a complete
rewrite, and refactoring of the popular PHPTemplate theme 
for Drupal 4.4.0.

This theme uses no external templating engine, to allow for 
remarkably robust templates without needing to modify the
engine.

PHPTemplate is being used as the basis for many of the largest
Drupal sites, such as Spreadfirefox.com and Drupal.org itself.
It is also the standard theme engine for Civicspace, although 
that might change with the 1.x releases.

The proto-template for PHPTemplate is box_grey, by Adrian Simmons
and it can be found on Drupal.org. Additionally, the default
template from the PHPTemplate theme in Drupal 4.4.0 is now called
cleanslate, and is available in the same place..

For more information on the reasons for not using a template engine
please see the following article:
http://www.phppatterns.com/index.php/article/articleview/4/1/1/

More complete documentation can be found on the Bryght public Wiki
at http://dev.bryght.com , and a subset of that documentation is 
also available in the Drupal handbook (http://drupal.org/node/11810).
